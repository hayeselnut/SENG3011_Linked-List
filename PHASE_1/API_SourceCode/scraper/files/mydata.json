People who own or come in contact with puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy around their pet., Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching your puppy or dog, after handling their food, and after cleaning up after them., Within a few days after getting a new puppy or dog, take it to a veterinarian for a health check-up., Puppies and dogs can carry Campylobacter germs that can make people sick, even while appearing healthy and clean. People who handle puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy around these animals., Ask store management for training about handwashing, clean-up procedures, and other illness prevention measures., Wash your hands with soap and water after handling puppies or dogs., Eat and store your food safely., Clean up messes safely., Follow store protocols for identifying and reporting sick or injured animals., Let your employer know if you or other employees become ill, especially with diarrhea or vomiting., Practice responsible use of antibiotics in pet stores., , CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant human Campylobacter jejuni infections linked to contact with puppies from pet stores., Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on Campylobacter bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter were related genetically to each other. This means that people in the outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection. WGS also showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter in the current outbreak are related genetically to a 2016\u20132018 outbreak of multidrug-resistant Campylobacter infections linked to pet store puppies., As of December 17, 2019, a total of 30 people infected with Campylobacter have been reported from 13 states. A list of the states and the number of confirmed cases in each state can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page., Illnesses started on dates ranging from January 6, 2019, through November 10, 2019. Ill people range in age from 8 months to 70 years, with a median age of 34; 52% of ill people are female. Of 26 people with information available, 4 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported., Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported., WGS analysis of 26 isolates from ill people predicted antibiotic resistance to tetracycline (26 isolates), ciprofloxacin (25), nalidixic acid (25), azithromycin (23), erythromycin (23), clindamycin (23), telithromycin (23), and gentamicin (18). Testing of one outbreak isolate using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by CDC\u2019s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results., Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that puppies purchased from pet stores are the likely source of this outbreak. Many of the cases had contact with puppies or were employees at pet stores, including Petland., CDC included ill people in this outbreak if, In interviews, ill people answered questions about dog, puppy, and other exposures they had in the week before they became ill. Of 24 people interviewed, 21 (88%) reported contact with a puppy in the week before illness started, and 15 (71%) of those 21 people reported contact with a puppy from a pet store. When asked about the specific pet store, 12 (80%) of those 15 people reported either having contact with a puppy or working at a Petland store., Investigators reported eight more ill people who had contact with a puppy at Petland and had a diagnostic test showing they were infected with Campylobacter bacteria. However, CDC did not include these people in the outbreak case count because no bacterial samples were available for WGS. Public health investigators use WGS to identify illnesses that are part of multistate outbreaks., A single, common supplier of puppies has not been identified. This investigation is ongoing.

A previous outbreak (the 10th) occurred in the same region and lasted nearly 2 years., The World Health Organization (WHO) is working with local health authorities to identify sources of transmission, conduct case investigation and case finding, strengthen local laboratory capacity, and to provide Ebola vaccine., For the latest information on this outbreak, including updates on numbers of cases and deaths, see the WHO Disease Outbreak News., Ebola virus disease (also known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever) is a rare and deadly disease that periodically causes outbreaks in several African countries. It is spread by contact with blood or body fluids of a person infected with Ebola virus. It is also spread by contact with contaminated objects or infected animals., Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising., The risk of Ebola infection for most travelers to DRC is low. Only those going to the outbreak area or who have contact with a person with Ebola are at risk. Travelers could become infected if they come in contact with blood or body fluids from an infected person. Family and friends caring for people with Ebola and health care workers who do not use correct infection control precautions are at higher risk., Although the risk for Ebola is low for most travelers to DRC, the risk of exposure to other diseases, including yellow fever, malaria, polio, hepatitis, rabies, meningitis and measles remains high. Before you leave for DRC, see a travel medicine provider:, During your time in DRC:, After returning:, Travelers who may have been exposed to Ebola or who become sick during or after travel should postpone further travel and get immediate medical attention.
