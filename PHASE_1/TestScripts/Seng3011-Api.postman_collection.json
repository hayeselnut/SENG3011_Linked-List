People who own or come in contact with puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy around their pet., Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching your puppy or dog, after handling their food, and after cleaning up after them., Within a few days after getting a new puppy or dog, take it to a veterinarian for a health check-up., Puppies and dogs can carry Campylobacter germs that can make people sick, even while appearing healthy and clean. People who handle puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy around these animals., Ask store management for training about handwashing, clean-up procedures, and other illness prevention measures., Wash your hands with soap and water after handling puppies or dogs., Eat and store your food safely., Clean up messes safely., Follow store protocols for identifying and reporting sick or injured animals., Let your employer know if you or other employees become ill, especially with diarrhea or vomiting., Practice responsible use of antibiotics in pet stores., , CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant human Campylobacter jejuni infections linked to contact with puppies from pet stores., Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on Campylobacter bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter were related genetically to each other. This means that people in the outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection. WGS also showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter in the current outbreak are related genetically to a 2016–2018 outbreak of multidrug-resistant Campylobacter infections linked to pet store puppies., As of December 17, 2019, a total of 30 people infected with Campylobacter have been reported from 13 states. A list of the states and the number of confirmed cases in each state can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page., Illnesses started on dates ranging from January 6, 2019, through November 10, 2019. Ill people range in age from 8 months to 70 years, with a median age of 34; 52% of ill people are female. Of 26 people with information available, 4 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported., Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported., WGS analysis of 26 isolates from ill people predicted antibiotic resistance to tetracycline (26 isolates), ciprofloxacin (25), nalidixic acid (25), azithromycin (23), erythromycin (23), clindamycin (23), telithromycin (23), and gentamicin (18). Testing of one outbreak isolate using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by CDC’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results., Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that puppies purchased from pet stores are the likely source of this outbreak. Many of the cases had contact with puppies or were employees at pet stores, including Petland., CDC included ill people in this outbreak if, In interviews, ill people answered questions about dog, puppy, and other exposures they had in the week before they became ill. Of 24 people interviewed, 21 (88%) reported contact with a puppy in the week before illness started, and 15 (71%) of those 21 people reported contact with a puppy from a pet store. When asked about the specific pet store, 12 (80%) of those 15 people reported either having contact with a puppy or working at a Petland store., Investigators reported eight more ill people who had contact with a puppy at Petland and had a diagnostic test showing they were infected with Campylobacter bacteria. However, CDC did not include these people in the outbreak case count because no bacterial samples were available for WGS. Public health investigators use WGS to identify illnesses that are part of multistate outbreaks., A single, common supplier of puppies has not been identified. This investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates if more information becomes available., Previous Updates &gt;&gt;\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/outbreaks/puppies-12-19/index.html\",\n            \"last_web_scrapped\": {\n                \"_seconds\": 1616510015,\n                \"_nanoseconds\": 116134000\n            },\n            \"headline\": \"Outbreak of Multidrug-resistant Campylobacter Infections Linked to Contact with Pet Store Puppies\",\n            \"reports\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"0\",\n                    \"locations\": [\n                        \"dummy -

People who handle puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy around these animals., Ask store management for training about handwashing, clean-up procedures, and other illness prevention measures., Wash your hands with soap and water after handling puppies or dogs., Eat and store your food safely., Clean up messes safely., Follow store protocols for identifying and reporting sick or injured animals., Let your employer know if you or other employees become ill, especially with diarrhea or vomiting., Practice responsible use of antibiotics in pet stores., , CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant human Campylobacter jejuni infections linked to contact with puppies from pet stores., Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on Campylobacter bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter were related genetically to each other. This means that people in the outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection. WGS also showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter in the current outbreak are related genetically to a 2016–2018 outbreak of multidrug-resistant Campylobacter infections linked to pet store puppies., As of December 17, 2019, a total of 30 people infected with Campylobacter have been reported from 13 states. A list of the states and the number of confirmed cases in each state can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page., Illnesses started on dates ranging from January 6, 2019, through November 10, 2019. Ill people range in age from 8 months to 70 years, with a median age of 34; 52% of ill people are female. Of 26 people with information available, 4 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported., Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported., WGS analysis of 26 isolates from ill people predicted antibiotic resistance to tetracycline (26 isolates), ciprofloxacin (25), nalidixic acid (25), azithromycin (23), erythromycin (23), clindamycin (23), telithromycin (23), and gentamicin (18). Testing of one outbreak isolate using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by CDC’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results., Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that puppies purchased from pet stores are the likely source of this outbreak. Many of the cases had contact with puppies or were employees at pet stores, including Petland., CDC included ill people in this outbreak if, In interviews, ill people answered questions about dog, puppy, and other exposures they had in the week before they became ill. Of 24 people interviewed, 21 (88%) reported contact with a puppy in the week before illness started, and 15 (71%) of those 21 people reported contact with a puppy from a pet store. When asked about the specific pet store, 12 (80%) of those 15 people reported either having contact with a puppy or working at a Petland store., Investigators reported eight more ill people who had contact with a puppy at Petland and had a diagnostic test showing they were infected with Campylobacter bacteria. However, CDC did not include these people in the outbreak case count because no bacterial samples were available for WGS. Public health investigators use WGS to identify illnesses that are part of multistate outbreaks., A single, common supplier of puppies has not been identified. This investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates if more information becomes available., Previous Updates &gt;&gt;\",\n            \"reports\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"0\",\n                    \"diseases\": [\n                        \"salmonellosis\"\n                    ],\n                    \"locations\": [\n                        \"dummy -

People who own or come in contact with puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy around their pet., Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching your puppy or dog, after handling their food, and after cleaning up after them., Within a few days after getting a new puppy or dog, take it to a veterinarian for a health check-up., Puppies and dogs can carry Campylobacter germs that can make people sick, even while appearing healthy and clean. People who handle puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy around these animals., Ask store management for training about handwashing, clean-up procedures, and other illness prevention measures., Wash your hands with soap and water after handling puppies or dogs., Eat and store your food safely., Clean up messes safely., Follow store protocols for identifying and reporting sick or injured animals., Let your employer know if you or other employees become ill, especially with diarrhea or vomiting., Practice responsible use of antibiotics in pet stores., , CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant human Campylobacter jejuni infections linked to contact with puppies from pet stores., Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on Campylobacter bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter were related genetically to each other. This means that people in the outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection. WGS also showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter in the current outbreak are related genetically to a 2016–2018 outbreak of multidrug-resistant Campylobacter infections linked to pet store puppies., As of December 17, 2019, a total of 30 people infected with Campylobacter have been reported from 13 states. A list of the states and the number of confirmed cases in each state can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page., Illnesses started on dates ranging from January 6, 2019, through November 10, 2019. Ill people range in age from 8 months to 70 years, with a median age of 34; 52% of ill people are female. Of 26 people with information available, 4 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported., Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported., WGS analysis of 26 isolates from ill people predicted antibiotic resistance to tetracycline (26 isolates), ciprofloxacin (25), nalidixic acid (25), azithromycin (23), erythromycin (23), clindamycin (23), telithromycin (23), and gentamicin (18). Testing of one outbreak isolate using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by CDC’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results., Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that puppies purchased from pet stores are the likely source of this outbreak. Many of the cases had contact with puppies or were employees at pet stores, including Petland., CDC included ill people in this outbreak if, In interviews, ill people answered questions about dog, puppy, and other exposures they had in the week before they became ill. Of 24 people interviewed, 21 (88%) reported contact with a puppy in the week before illness started, and 15 (71%) of those 21 people reported contact with a puppy from a pet store. When asked about the specific pet store, 12 (80%) of those 15 people reported either having contact with a puppy or working at a Petland store., Investigators reported eight more ill people who had contact with a puppy at Petland and had a diagnostic test showing they were infected with Campylobacter bacteria. However, CDC did not include these people in the outbreak case count because no bacterial samples were available for WGS. Public health investigators use WGS to identify illnesses that are part of multistate outbreaks., A single, common supplier of puppies has not been identified. This investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates if more information becomes available., Previous Updates &gt;&gt;\",\n            \"date_of_publication\": \"2021-03-08T08:35:25.000Z\",\n            \"reports\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"0\",\n                    \"event_date\": {\n                        \"_seconds\": 1614038400,\n                        \"_nanoseconds\": 0\n                    },\n                    \"locations\": [\n                        \"dummy -

People at risk for acquiring HAV infection or developing serious complications from HAV infection during the current hepatitis A outbreaks should be prioritized to receive the hepatitis A vaccine as soon as it is possible to do so safely., , , NR: not publicly reported, In response to all hepatitis outbreaks, CDC provides ongoing epidemiology and laboratory support as well as support on vaccine supply and vaccine policy development. When requested, CDC sends “disease detectives” to affected areas to evaluate and assist in an outbreak response. CDC alerts other public health jurisdictions of any increases in disease. All jurisdictions are encouraged to be watchful for increases in hepatitis A cases. CDC also works with state and local health officials to ensure hepatitis A vaccine is targeted to the correct at-risk populations and that supply is adequate., Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended for unvaccinated people who have been exposed to hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the last 2 weeks; those with evidence of previous vaccination do not require PEP., PEP consists of:, PEP Recommendations:, NOTE: CDC recommends that all children be vaccinated against hepatitis A at age 1 year. Parents or caregivers who are unsure if a child has been vaccinated should consult the child’s health-care provider to confirm vaccination status., State health departments wanting to submit specimens must contact CDC at hepaoutbreaklab@cdc.gov for approval before shipping specimens to CDC.

People who own or come in contact with puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy around their pet., Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching your puppy or dog, after handling their food, and after cleaning up after them., Within a few days after getting a new puppy or dog, take it to a veterinarian for a health check-up., Puppies and dogs can carry Campylobacter germs that can make people sick, even while appearing healthy and clean. People who handle puppies or dogs should take steps to stay healthy around these animals., Ask store management for training about handwashing, clean-up procedures, and other illness prevention measures., Wash your hands with soap and water after handling puppies or dogs., Eat and store your food safely., Clean up messes safely., Follow store protocols for identifying and reporting sick or injured animals., Let your employer know if you or other employees become ill, especially with diarrhea or vomiting., Practice responsible use of antibiotics in pet stores., , CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant human Campylobacter jejuni infections linked to contact with puppies from pet stores., Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on Campylobacter bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter were related genetically to each other. This means that people in the outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection. WGS also showed that bacteria from people infected with Campylobacter in the current outbreak are related genetically to a 2016–2018 outbreak of multidrug-resistant Campylobacter infections linked to pet store puppies., As of December 17, 2019, a total of 30 people infected with Campylobacter have been reported from 13 states. A list of the states and the number of confirmed cases in each state can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page., Illnesses started on dates ranging from January 6, 2019, through November 10, 2019. Ill people range in age from 8 months to 70 years, with a median age of 34; 52% of ill people are female. Of 26 people with information available, 4 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported., Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported., WGS analysis of 26 isolates from ill people predicted antibiotic resistance to tetracycline (26 isolates), ciprofloxacin (25), nalidixic acid (25), azithromycin (23), erythromycin (23), clindamycin (23), telithromycin (23), and gentamicin (18). Testing of one outbreak isolate using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by CDC’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results., Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that puppies purchased from pet stores are the likely source of this outbreak. Many of the cases had contact with puppies or were employees at pet stores, including Petland., CDC included ill people in this outbreak if, In interviews, ill people answered questions about dog, puppy, and other exposures they had in the week before they became ill. Of 24 people interviewed, 21 (88%) reported contact with a puppy in the week before illness started, and 15 (71%) of those 21 people reported contact with a puppy from a pet store. When asked about the specific pet store, 12 (80%) of those 15 people reported either having contact with a puppy or working at a Petland store., Investigators reported eight more ill people who had contact with a puppy at Petland and had a diagnostic test showing they were infected with Campylobacter bacteria. However, CDC did not include these people in the outbreak case count because no bacterial samples were available for WGS. Public health investigators use WGS to identify illnesses that are part of multistate outbreaks., A single, common supplier of puppies has not been identified. This investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates if more information becomes available., Previous Updates &gt;&gt;\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"aab3238922bcc25a6f606eb525ffdc56\",\n            \"date_of_publication\": \"2021-03-15T00:00:00.000Z\",\n            \"headline\": \"COVID-19 in Trinidad and Tobago\",\n            \"url\": \"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/covid-2/coronavirus-trinidad-and-tobago\",\n            \"main_text\": \" New Travel RequirementsAll air passengers coming to the United States, including U.S. citizens, are required to have a negative COVID-19 test result or documentation of recovery from COVID-19 before they board a flight to the United States.
