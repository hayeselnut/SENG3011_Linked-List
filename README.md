# Overview

## Product

We at Linked-list will be initially making a API web service that scrapes data from the CDC website [https://www.cdc.gov/](https://www.cdc.gov/). Given a period of interest, key search terms - names of diseases and syndromes -, and location, our API should respond with a JSONified summary of the reports about the searched for terms. 

## Future of the product

In the coming weeks we will be updating our product to include these features, as well as API documentation, for developers to access our API directly as well as a react frontend, where end users can search terms easily and get responses on a website. 

## Stack

To do this we will be using python and beautifulsoup4, to scrape the data then this will be stored in firebase's firestore. How to access our database will be through our serverless API, which is hosted on google cloud functions. 

# Expectations and timelines

We have split the development of this product into clear stages. 

## Stage 1

### Deliverable 1

By March 5, this project will be well underway. The team will be working tirelessly to bring this amazing product to you. 

### Deliverable 2

By March 20 we should have shipped Deliverable 1. This includes, the specification and design for our API - as described above. 

### Deliverable 3

If we have enough time, we will have a basic frontend up that give users a very easy way to access our API, rather than having to go through the documentation. Hopefully, we will also have integrated another dataset, and have some interesting insights to how different syndromes and diseases begin to spread and cause outbreaks. 

## Stage 2

### Deliverable 4

We will be collaborating with other disease API projects, to again bring the user, YOU, the best possible insights that we have do to with disease and syndrome reports. In addition to this we will have greatly improved our frontend features, to add analytics features, prediction of outbreaks and data visualisation. 

## Future

We at Linked-List are hoping to provide you a way to maximise the insight and knowledge you take away from one search. Using the power of data analytics and multiple data sources, your one search will provide you with the global picture.
